# About
  This project has been developed with intent to create a tool that bundles your screeps code into a single file without using advanced optimizations provided by [Ð¡losure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler),
  and solve the problem with unrecognizable and obfuscated runtime errors to make them understandable.
  
  The project uses: 
  - [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs): Code compilation
  - [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) with [babel-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/babel-loader/): Bundling
  - [clojurescript-screeps-sourcemap](https://github.com/timonkot131/clojurescript-screeps-sourcemap): Individual package for error pre-processing in screeps
  
# Installation
  First you need to have [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/), [node-js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  and java SDK installed, then install the template:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/timonkot131/clojurescript-screeps-webpack.git
  cd clojurescript-screeps-webpack
  lein install
  ```
  After that, you can create your project
  ```
  lein new org.clojars.timonkot13/clojurescript-screeps-webpack project-name
  cd project-name
  npm install
  ```
# Usage
  You can run some of these commands which are mostly ``npx shadow-cljs build/watch`` and ``npx webpack`` aliases
  ### Build project
  ```
  npm run build
  ```
  ### Bundle project
  ```
  npm run bundle
  ```
  ### Watching project changes
  ```
  npm run build-watch
  npm run bundle-watch
 ```
# Deploying
  There are no deploying tools in the project right now, but you can modify the bundle output path in webpack.config.js
  ```
    ...
    entry: ... ,
    output: {
        path: "<your path>", // as example, you can change it to your screeps local folder,
                             // you can get the path by selecting "Scripts tab" and then clicking on "Open local folder"
        filename: "main.js",
    }
  ```
